## Synopsis

Pacman got lost in his labyrinth. Go through the maze collecting white balls and getting score before you rescue him.

Beware of phantoms! they are relentless...

## Context

This is my first contact with VR. With a simple idea (like maze) it's possible to investigate the power of A-Frame library.

js13k compo was the best excuse to try it!
